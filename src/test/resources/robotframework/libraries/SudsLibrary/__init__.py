    """SudsLibrary is a library for functional testing of SOAP-based web
    services.

    SudsLibrary is based on [https://fedorahosted.org/suds/|Suds], a dynamic
    SOAP 1.1 client.

    == Case Sensitivy in SudsLibrary ==
    Many things in the world of SOAP are case-sensitive. This includes method
    names, WSDL object names and attributes, and service or port names.

    == Creating and Configuring a Client ==
    If necessary, use keywords `Bind Schema To Location` or `Add Doctor
    Import`. These are rarely needed. Next, `Create Soap Client` to create a Suds
    client. The output from this keyword contains useful information including
    available types and methods. Next, use other keywords to configure the
    client as necessary. `Set Location` is the most commonly needed keyword.

    == Working with WSDL Objects ==
    When Suds digests a WSDL, it creates dynamic types to represent the complex
    types defined by a WSDL or its imports. These types are listed in the
    output of `Create Soap Client`. WSDL objects are used as method arguments,
    attribute values of other WSDL objects, and return values. `Create Wsdl
    Object` is used to create instances of WSDL object types. To see what the
    structure of a WSDL object is, you can do this:
    | ${obj}=        | Create Wsdl Object | someObject |
    | ${obj as str}= | Convert To String  | ${obj}     |
    | Log            | ${obj as str}      |            |
    The same technique can be used to analyze a response object. It may also
    help to use a tool such as Eclipse or SoapUI to comprehend the structures.

    === Getting WSDL Object Attributes ===
    Getting a WSDL object's attribute value may be done with `Get Wsdl Object
    Attribute` or extended variable syntax*. Keywords from other libraries, such
    as _BuiltIn_ and _Collections_ may be used to verify attribute values.
    Examples:
    | ${name}=        | Get Wsdl Object Attribute | ${person} | name |
    | Should Be Equal | ${person.name}            | Bob       |      |

    === Setting WSDL Object Attributes ===
    Setting a WSDL object's attribute value may be done with `Set Wsdl Object
    Attribute` or extended variable syntax*. `Set Wsdl Object Attribute`
    verifies the argument is an object of the correct type and the attribute
    exists.
    | Set Wsdl Object Attribute | ${person}    | name | Tia |
    | ${person.name}=           | Set Variable | Tia  |     |

    * In order to use extended variable syntax, the attribute name must consist
    of only letters, numbers, and underscores.

    == Example Test ==
    The following simple example demonstrates verifying the return value using
    keywords in this library and in the `BuiltIn` and `Collections` libraries.
    You can run this test because it uses a public web service.

    | Create Soap Client         | http://www.webservicex.net/Statistics.asmx?WSDL |               |              |
    | ${dbl array}=              | Create Wsdl Object                              | ArrayOfDouble |              |
    | Append To List             | ${dbl array.double}                             | 2.0           |              |
    | Append To List             | ${dbl array.double}                             | 3.0           |              |
    | ${result}=                 | Call Soap Method                                | GetStatistics | ${dbl array} |
    | Should Be Equal As Numbers | ${result.Average}                               | 2.5           |              |

    The definition of type ArrayOfDouble:
    | <s:complexType name="ArrayOfDouble">
    |   <s:sequence>
    |     <s:element minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded" name="double" type="s:double"/>
    |   </s:sequence>
    | </s:complexType>
    Note that the attribute name on the ArrayOfDouble-type that is the list of
    numbers is the singular "double". Outside of the WSDL, the structure can
    also be seen in the output of Create Wsdl Object:
    | ${dbl array} = (ArrayOfDouble){
    |   double[] = <empty>
    | }

    The relevant part of the WSDL defining the parameters to the method:
    | <s:element name="GetStatistics">
    |   <s:complexType>
    |     <s:sequence>
    |       <s:element minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1" name="X" type="tns:ArrayOfDouble"/>
    |     </s:sequence>
    |   </s:complexType>
    | </s:element>
    The definition of this method appears in the output of Create Soap Client
    as:
    | GetStatistics(ArrayOfDouble X, )

    == Passing Explicit NULL Values ==
    If you have a service that takes NULL values for required parameters or
    you want to pass NULL for optional object attributes, you simply need to
    set the value to ${SUDS_NULL}. You need to use ${SUDS_NULL} instead of
    ${None} because None is interpreted by the marshaller as not having a
    value. The soap message will contain an empty (and xsi:nil="true" if node
    defined as nillable). ${SUDS_NULL} is defined during library
    initialization, so editors like RIDE will not show it as defined.

    == Extending SudsLibrary ==
    There may be times where Suds/SudsLibrary does not work using the library
    keywords alone. Extending the library instead of writing a custom one will
    allow you to use the existing keywords in SudsLibrary.

    There are two methods useful for extending SudsLibrary:
    | _client()
    | _add_client(client, alias=None)
    The first can be used to access the current instance of
    suds.client.Client. The second can be used to put a client into the client
    cache that you have instantiated.

    Here is an example demonstrating how to implement a keyword that adds a
    MessagePlugin to the current Suds client (based on the [https://fedorahosted.org/suds/wiki/Documentation#MessagePlugin|Suds documentation]):
    | from robot.libraries.BuiltIn import BuiltIn
    | from suds.plugin import MessagePlugin
    |
    | class _MyPlugin(MessagePlugin):
    |     def marshalled(self, context):
    |         body = context.envelope.getChild('Body')
    |         foo = body[0]
    |         foo.set('id', '12345')
    |         foo.set('version', '2.0')
    |
    | class SudsLibraryExtensions(object):
    |     def attach_my_plugin(self):
    |         client = BuiltIn().get_library_instance("SudsLibrary")._client()
    |         # prepend so SudsLibrary's plugin is left in place
    |         plugins = client.options.plugins
    |         if any(isinstance(x, _MyPlugin) for x in plugins):
    |             return
    |         plugins.insert(0, _MyPlugin())
    |         client.set_options(plugins=plugins)
