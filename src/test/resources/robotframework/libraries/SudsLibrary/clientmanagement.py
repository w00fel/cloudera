        Returns the index of this client instance which can be used later to
        switch back to it. See `Switch Soap Client` for example.

        Optional alias is an alias for the client instance and it can be used
        for switching between clients (just as index can be used). See `Switch
        Soap Client` for more details.

        Autoblend ensures that the schema(s) defined within the WSDL import
        each other.

        `timeout` sets the timeout for SOAP requests and must be given in
        Robot Framework's time format (e.g. '1 minute', '2 min 3 s', '4.5').

        Examples:
        | Create Soap Client | http://localhost:8080/ws/Billing.asmx?WSDL |
        | Create Soap Client | ${CURDIR}/../wsdls/tracking.wsdl |

    def switch_soap_client(self, index_or_alias):
        """Switches between clients using index or alias.

        Index is returned from `Create Soap Client` and alias can be given to
        it.

        Example:
        | Create Soap Client  | http://localhost:8080/Billing?wsdl   | Billing   |
        | Create Soap Client  | http://localhost:8080/Marketing?wsdl | Marketing |
        | Call Soap Method    | sendSpam                             |           |
        | Switch Soap Client  | Billing                              | # alias   |
        | Call Soap Method    | sendInvoices                         |           |
        | Switch Soap Client  | 2                                    | # index   |

        Above example expects that there was no other clients created when
        creating the first one because it used index '1' when switching to it
        later. If you aren't sure about that you can store the index into
        a variable as below.

        | ${id} =            | Create Soap Client  | ... |
        | # Do something ... |                     |     |
        | Switch Soap Client      | ${id}          |     |
